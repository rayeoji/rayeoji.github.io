							<h1>About Me</h1>
							
							<p>As you hopefully know by now, my name is Raye Oji and I'm currently in my junior year of undergraduate studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am pursuing a B.A in Computer Science, with minors in Information Systems and French. Unlike most of my peers here at UNC, I am not from North Carolina or even from the United States. I moved to the US at the age of 18 in 2020 to attend UNC, but I'm actually from Nigeria. After I was born in London, UK, my family moved back home to Nigeria when I was three years old. That's where I grew up from ages 3 to 16, in Lagos, Nigeria. At the age of 16, I returned to England for the last two years of high school and completed the International Baccalaureate (IB) program in Oxford. It was after completing high school there that I migrated once again to the US.</p>
							<p>Having lived in two epicentres of multiculturalism and economic growth (Lagos & London), I became aware of the growing capabilities of technology at a young age. I knew that I didn't want to be left behind in the rapid technological advancements our society was making, but rather I wanted to be at the forefront. These are some of the reasons I decided to pursue Computer Science and Information Systems. Similarly, I knew that being multilingual would be an invaluable benefit in our increasingly globalized world, which led to my French minor. </p>
							<p>Outside of academics, my interests lie in literature and fashion. I am both an avid creator and consumer of literature, and writing is easily one of my favorite pastimes. I also enjoy learning about fashion houses and trends in my free time, and brainstorming ways to incorporate them into my own wardrobe. </p>
